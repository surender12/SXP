#define AboutUsText @"About SXC\n\nSXC is an App created with the intention to improve your sex life. The founders are students within the spiritual school “The New Tantra” (TNT), from where much of the teachings in the App derive. Some TNT workshops are sexual and those generally revolutionise people’s sex life. However, not everybody is willing to go to workshops to learn about sex. The idea behind SXC is that you as a user safely explore without having to show yourself if you do not want to. Through SXC we hope the user will go from wanting, craving or fearing sex to instead enjoy sex on a much deeper level. Hardly anybody got a proper sex education when growing up, on the contrary most of us are conditioned with fear and shame around sexuality. But this is not your fault and why let it stop you from going deeper into the land of sexual magic? Truly, the potential pleasure is beyond what people generally think is possible.\n\nFeedback\nWe generally do not know that well how other people see us. Therefore honest and well-intended feedback is very helpful for us to grow as human beings. This is also true when it comes to sex and for the users that wish so, there is a great feedback system available for you and your lovers. Our performance in bed is for most people a sensitive subject, but what would you rather chose; to become a better lover by knowing what others think of you or to just pretend you do not care? Really, the only way to become a great lover is to give others beautiful sex experiences. That is what SXC is all about, to give because it simply is wonderful to see our lovers fulfilled. To be able to give in a satisfying way we need feedback.\n\nCrowd funding and The Foundation\nThe Beta version is more like a teaser and we are launching a crowd funding campaign to finance the programming of the full version of SXC. The full version will contain all the deepest sexual teachings available through TNT and our partners, much of it completely unknown to the general public. Furthermore we will create a new community online where you, if you wish to, can become one of the sexual practitioners who want to learn from and serve each other. The purpose of the crowd funding is to get the word out, but also to support our vision of “The Foundation”. The idea is that a non-profit Swedish Foundation with solid by-laws will own the SXC. There are three reasons for this: (i) to safeguard you as a user from soulless capitalistic forces, (ii) to guarantee the content is serving humans rather than the system and (iii) to be able to give at least 10% of the profit to spreading the word about tantra and help bringing up undamaged children. This cannot be guaranteed if we have to bring in external investors to fund the development of SXC. Please support or crowd funding campaign at:\n(www.XXX.com)."

#define PrivatePolicyText @"PRIVACY POLICY (strict for user)\n\nSXC, Inc. ('SXC,' 'we,' and “us”) respects the privacy of its users (“you”) and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. SXC is built to keep you anonymous as long as you do not actively choose to reveal who you are. Our intention is to never expose anybody against their will and we do not have the intention to share any personal information with a third party. However this world is full of hackers, local laws, loopholes and greedy lawyers. SXC does not have the knowledge or the resources to provide our website or application (our 'Service'), without protecting us against potential legal actions. We are sorry, but as long as we live in this kind of society we will need agreements like this:\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.\n\nInformation we collect about you\nIn General. We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address ('personal information') and other information that does not identify you. We may collect this information through a website or a mobile application. By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service.\n\nInformation you provide.

You will also be asked to allow SXC to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your gender and preferences for recommendations, such as search distance, age range and gender. If you chat with other SXC users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.\n\nUse of technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on our Service.\n\nInformation collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.\n\nCookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you SXC advertisements on other sites or applications.\n\nOther Technologies. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Service and to deliver or communicate with cookies. We also may include web beacons in advertisements or email messages to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer users, to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.\n\nInformation collected by third-parties for advertising purposes. We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymized personal information to third parties. Some of these third- party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.\n\nHow we use the information we collect\nIn General. We may use information that we collect about you to:\ndeliver and improve our products and services, and manage our business;/nmanage your account and provide you with customer support;\nperform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others’ products, services, or content;\ncommunicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;\ndevelop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;\nwebsite or mobile application analytics;\nverify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;\nenforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use; and perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.\nJob applicants. If your personal information is submitted through our website when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application. We may retain your personal information, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions. This information, which may include your name and contact information, prior education and experience, and other information you provide to us, may be shared with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings. In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us. Also, if you access our Service from a third party social platform, such as Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to the extent permitted by your agreement with it and its privacy settings.\nWith whom we share your information\n\nInformation Shared with Other Users. When you register as a user of SXC, your SXC profile will not be viewable by other users of the Service. However, if you start using the features  “Lovers” and/or “Meet” other users will be able to view information you have provided to us directly or through Facebook, such as your Facebook photos, any additional photos you upload, your first name, your age, approximate number of miles away, your personal description, and information you have in common with the person viewing your profile, such as common Facebook friends and likes. If you chat with anybody using the Service, of course the other will see the content of your chat.\nPersonal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:\nService providers: We may share information, including personal and financial information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Service. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.\nOther Situations. We may disclose your information, including personal information:\nIn response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.\nWhen we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.\nIn connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.\nAggregated and/or non-personal information. We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non- personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to http:// www.aboutads.info/choices/.\n\nHow you can access your information. If you have a SXC account, you have the ability to review and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. You also may close your account at any time by visiting the 'Settings' page for your account. If you close your account, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.\n\nYour choices about collection and use of your information\nYou can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.\nOur Service may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications by deleting the relevant Service or by changing the settings on your mobile device.\nYou can also control information collected by cookies. You can delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click 'help' in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.\nHow we protect your personal information. We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.\nInformation you provide about yourself while using our Service. We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.\nChildren's privacy. Although our Service is a general audience Service, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from individuals under the age of 18.\nVisiting our Service from outside Sweden. If you are visiting our Service from outside Sweden, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Sweden and globally where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.\nNo Rights of Third Parties. This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy. We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the 'last updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.\nHow to contact us If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email as follows:\n\nprivacy@SXC.app"

#define TermOfUseText @"Terms of Use\n\nWelcome to SXC, operated by SXC, Inc. (the “Company” or “SXC”).\n\nThe Rule\n\nIn SXC you can do whatever you want as long as you do not hurt anybody else.\n\nGuidelines\nYou enrol in this game by free will and are responsible for your own actions. Our view is that we are all born free in this world and should have the right to live as free human beings. This also implies you being 100% responsible for your own happiness.\nThe intention behind an action is generally what matters, but we also ask you as a user to wield common sense. The whole idea behind SXC is that users help each other to improve their sex life. Try therefore to always have the intention to serve your friends and lovers in this community. What goes around comes around. However this is not about charity and complete honesty is fundamental. Nobody will benefit from getting false feedback, but try to give feedback in a loving and constructive way.\n\nThe Law\nIn modern civilization society has built an incredibly complicated system that no human being is capable of overviewing or understand fully. The Law regulates the system and this is by most people seen as The Truth of how we should live our lives. In fact many people are ok with using violence towards not violent human beings just to withhold   The Law. This despite the fact that The Law is constantly changing everywhere and moreover The Law is different wherever you go! This means The Law per definition cannot be The Truth. It is a system to keep humanity under control and of course it serves a purpose since many of us are damaged and potentially dangerous, but maybe it has gone to far when the system is in control – not you and me as human beings.\nHowever, until the day when we can get a long in peace with the only Rule above, SXC also has to adapt to The Law. Sorry for that, but we don’t want to get sued or shut down so here it goes:\nBy accessing the SXC application or its website found at www.sxc.app, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”), whether or not you create a SXC account.

The Company may terminate or suspend your account at any time without notice if the Company believes that you have breached this Agreement, or for any other reason, with or without cause, in its sole discretion. Upon such termination or suspension, you will not be entitled to any refund of unused fees for in app purchases. The Company is not required to disclose, and may be prohibited by law from disclosing, the reason for the termination or suspension of your account. After your account is terminated for any reason, all terms of this Agreement survive such termination, and continue in full force and effect, except for any terms that by their nature expire or are fully satisfied.\nNon-commercial Use by Users.

THE COMPANY ALSO DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ALL OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS.

As noted in and without limiting Sections 15 and 17 below, in no event shall the Company, its affiliates or its partners be liable (directly or indirectly) for any losses or damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, general, special, compensatory, consequential, and/or incidental, arising out of or relating to the conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the use of the Service including, without limitation, death, bodily injury, emotional distress, and/or any other damages resulting from communications or meetings with other users or persons you meet through the Service.
